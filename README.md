pront(Name1 was desperate for some cash  he had accidentally bought 100""""He needed a job.  That was when he remembered  that  he had that old (job ) costume from halloween 2 years ago. That job made a whole (amount of money ) $ a week!)

#Name 1 (adjective that ends in Y)  put on a mustache for good measure. Name1 was sure that with  this elaborate disguise no one would come close to even  noticing. Later that day it was show time, name1 (verb that ends in ed) to work enveloped in (feeling that ends with ness).   But then one of  name1’s friends sees through your plan.  name1 is shocked how could they simply see through such a  (adjective costume) deguise ?! name 1  pulls you aside ” why are you wearing that ( term for bad adjective) costume !”
 
 #Well you see i needed money I bought  a 100 (products)
 #If you need money why don't you just sell those? I heard there is a very high demand especially since (celebrity) endorsed it saying they “could not live without it” and it is the “only reason that they get up in the morning.” after hearing that name1 bursting with (emotion ) screamed i'm RICH and ran away. All the other (job) where quite confused.

# MadLibs


# Instructions

Write a program that will ask the user for a series of words. Then plug them into your short story.

Be careful! **Make sure your prompts and variables match up with how you use them in your story.**


# Criteria/Constraints
*   Prompts
    *   Prompts match up with the order the words are used in the story.
    *   At least 8 inputs/variables
    *   Inputs should use a variety of parts of speech (noun, adjective, verb, etc.) and/or specific types of nouns (place, food, etc.)
*   Short story
    *   Has proper spelling and grammar
    *   Is at least 6 sentences/lines long.
*   Print statements
    *   At least one `print()` statement that outputs on multiple lines (ie. uses `"\n"`)
    *   At least one `print()` statement that concatenates (“adds”) two strings together (eg. `"Hello " + "world"`)
    *   At least one f-string or `.format()` that correctly inserts the variables.

# Sample Run

```
Let's play Silly Sentences!

Enter a name: Grace
Enter an adjective: stinky
Enter an adjective: blue
Enter an adverb: quietly
Enter a food: soup
Enter another food: bananas
Enter a noun: button
Enter a place: Paris
Enter a verb: jump

Grace was planning a dream vacation to Paris.
Grace was especially looking forward to trying the local
cuisine, including stinky soup and bananas.

Grace will have to practice the language quietly to
make it easier to jump with people.

Grace has a long list of sights to see, including the
button museum and the blue park.
```


# Sample Template

You should write your own prompt, but your output should be based on a template like this:

```
Let's play Silly Sentences!

[name] was planning a dream vacation to [place].
[name] was especially looking forward to trying the local
cuisine, including [adjective 1] [food 1] and [food 2].


[name] will have to practice the language [adverb] to
make it easier to [verb] with people.


[name] has a long list of sights to see, including the
[noun] museum and the [adjective 2] park.
```

# Benchmarks

As you work on this assignment, you may find it helpful to track your progress against the benchmarks listed below.  Follow the steps in order to ensure that you are writing clear, concise code that will meet all criteria.  Remember that the formatting of your output must be exact - be careful about the spacing and line breaks.


1. Using the `print()` function, output, "Let's play Silly Sentences!"  
2. Using the `input()` function, prompt the user to, `"Enter a name: "`, then assign and store their response to a variable.
3. Repeat benchmark 2 for the other 8 inputs that we need from the user:
   1. (eg. adjective, adjective, adverb, food, food, noun, place, and verb.)
4. Using a `print()` function, output a line such as:
   1. `"[name] was planning a dream vacation to [place]."` Replace `[name]` and `[place]` with the proper variables.
5. Repeat step 4 with the other 6 lines of output.
6. Double-check to make sure the output is formatted correctly - including spaces before and after variables and line spacing.
7. Run and test your program.
8. Debug and repeat step 7 as needed.
